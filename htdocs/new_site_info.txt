<!-- For production servers you should consider replacing this file with one 
  that is not tracked by git and setting and setting the variable
  $webworkFiles{site_info} in localOverrides.conf.  This will prevent the file 
  from being overwritten when you switch branches or by upgrades.

<!-- DONE! Old file is site_info.txt
